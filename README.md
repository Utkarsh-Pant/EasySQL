# **EasySQL**
### A gui-based application software built using Python (Tkinter + MySQL)

Intended to be a learning/development tool to easily execute SQL queries without need for directly executing or knowledge of proper syntaxing.
Additionally also adds the query to the clipboard for those intersted to learn and/or modify the queries manually.
Currently only made to be a python application; future plans for converting into an executable and publishing onto package managers like WingGet, APT, etc.


## Dependencies

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

- Tkinter
- Pillow
- MySQL Python Connector
- PyPerClip
- Regular Expressions

Additonally, ensure that the system has a mysql server properly setup.

> Note: Ensure that you have installed `mysql-connector-python`; not just `mysql-connector`

## Installation and Running

The program should run simply using `py main.py` ( or `python main.py` / `python3 main.py` depending on the system )

## Additional Notes

The current version is a very beta version i.e. still very much in development. Using the program currently might have issues in running certain commands and many other bugs. 
Currently working on cleaning up the code, and smoothing out any obvious mistakes. After that will focus on improving the GUI experience and ensuring everything is working properly before moving to future plans.

Any bugs and issues found are much appreciated :)
